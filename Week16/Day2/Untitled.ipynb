    "1. Take a moment to study the new data set `miles-walked-this-month.csv`.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Use the `d3.timeParse` method in order to create a new function to parse the month from the CSV data and save the function to a variable.  You will need to pass the `%B` token as an argument into the `d3.timeParse` method in order to properly configure the new function to create a `Date` object from a string month.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Run a `forEach` loop on the `milesData`. Cast the `miles` property of each element in the `milesData` array to a number. Use the time parser function created in the last step to convert the `month` for each element into a `Date` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Configure your x and y scales as `xTimeScale` and `yLinearScale`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create your axes generator functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Run the `d3.line` method to create and save a new line generator function. Configure this function to plot the x-axis using `xTimeScale` function, passing in the `date` value for each element in the data set. Then, configure this function to plot the y-axis using the `yLinearScale` function, passing in the `miles` property for each element in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Append an SVG `path` to the SVG group element. Set the `d` attribute of the new SVG `path` using the line generator function created in the last step. Pass `milesData` into the line generator as an argument.  Give this element a class of \"line\".\n",

    "11. Append two `<g>` elements and use the axes generator functions you created in step 7 to append an axis to each.  Make sure to place these elements to correctly display your axes.\n",
