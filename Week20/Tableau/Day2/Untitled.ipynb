    "\n",
    "* Use it to try to visualize some interesting questions, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Is there a relationship between an institution's average ACT/SAT scores and the average number of doctorates awarded?\n",
    "  * Which regions in the United States have the greatest percentage of students receiving federal grant aid?\n",
    "  * Is there a correlation between SAT scores and regions?\n",
    "  * Of the institutions with religious affiliations, schools belonging to which denominations receive the most foreign undergraduate students?\n",
    "  * Do foreign undergraduates prefer institutions that award only bachelor's degrees, or master's, or doctorates?\n",
    "  * Of institutions that offer bachelor's, master's, or doctorates as the highest degrees, which have the highest graduation rates within four years?\n",
    "  * Is there a correlation between tuition and SAT scores?"
